## Releases

Releases are made through git tags using semantic versioning. Where `MAJOR.MINOR.PATH`:
- `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
- `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and

To create a release you should push a tag starting with `v`to the master branch. For example
```bash
git tag v0.1.2
git push --tags
```
