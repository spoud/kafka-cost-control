=== Metric database

In order to store the metrics, we recommend using a timeserie database. Feel free to chose one that suits your needs. Be careful to chose one that is compatible with Kafka connect so you can easily transfer metrics from kafka to your database. In this example we will assume that you're using TimescaleDB because it's the one we provide kubernetes manifest for.

==== Database Schema

Feel free to adapt the partition size to fit your needs. In this example we put 7 days but please follow the link:https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/hypertables/about-hypertables/#best-practices-for-time-partitioning[TimescaleDB documentation] to choose the right partition size for your use case. We recommend a value between 7 days and 1 month. Note that the Helm and Kustomize templates already execute this script when the database is created.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;
CREATE TABLE "kafka_aggregated-table-friendly"
(
    "startTime"         TIMESTAMP        NOT NULL,
    "endTime"           TIMESTAMP        NOT NULL,
    "entityType"        VARCHAR          NOT NULL,
    "initialMetricName" VARCHAR          NOT NULL,
    "name"              VARCHAR          NOT NULL,
    "value"             DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    "cost"              DOUBLE PRECISION NULL,
    "tags"              JSONB            NOT NULL,
    "context"           JSONB            NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY ("startTime", "endTime", "entityType", "initialMetricName", "name")
);

SELECT create_hypertable('kafka_aggregated-table-friendly', by_range('startTime', INTERVAL '7 day'));
----

To prevent the database from being overwhelmed by the amount of data, we recommend creating a retention policy. In this example we will keep the data for 2 years:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT add_retention_policy('kafka_aggregated-table-friendly', INTERVAL '2 years');
----

if you want to run the scripts above manually, you can use the interactive cli.
[source,shell]
----
kubectl exec -it -n <namespace> timescaledb-0 -- psql -U postgres -d postgres
